# minipythonproject
For this mini project I used Python to make a take-home pay calculator.

The programme asks the user for information about their gross salary, overtime, bonuses, pension contributions and uses this data to calculate the income tax bands (and therefore the income tax) and National Insurance.

The national insurance and income tax are then subtracted from the pre-tax gross income to provide the user with their annual/monthly/weekly/daily take-home pay.
